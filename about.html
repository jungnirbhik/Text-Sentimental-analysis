        <p>Sentiment Analysis App is target-oriented, aiming to identify opinions or attitudes towards topics or entities (e.g., product, movie). Emotion recognition, on the other hand, focuses on recognizing either the emotion expressed in text or evoked by the text, with no attachment to a specific target. 
            Expressions can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral.</p>
        <p>By using <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000">Sentiment Analysis App</a> we can:</p></h5>
        <ul>
           <h5> <li>Analyze customer feedback, survey responses, and product reviews.</li>
            <li>Overlook social media monitoring, reputation management, and customer experience.</li>
            <li>Helps businesses to understand the emotion and sentiments of their customers.</li>
            
        </h5>
        </ul>
        <p><h5>Companies analyze customer's sentiment through social media conversations and reviews so they can make better-informed decisions.
        This provides you an edge over your competitors. For instance, when your competitor launches a new product or service, you can use our Sentiment Analysis App to understand what customers like and dislike about their offering and use that feedback to improve your own products or services.
